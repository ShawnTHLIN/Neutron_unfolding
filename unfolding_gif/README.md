# The unfolding method of Gravel algorithm
author: Tzu-Hsiang Lin

The presented alogorithm is proposed by M. Matzka in 1994.[1]

The iterative equations[2] is described as

where n is the degree of freedom


# The iterative process of GRAVEL  algorithm
To examine the ability of this unfolding algorithm, initial guess is given a flat spectrum.

This is a demonstration. Actually, the iterative process would be terminated when the iterative number arrived 8.
